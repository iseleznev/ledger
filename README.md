# ledger

## About

This is my own high-load free ledger service, written in Java and designed for performance and reliability.

The project uses:

Off-heap memory for efficient resource usage

Ring buffer for high-throughput event handling

Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability

PostgreSQL as the primary storage engine

I started this project out of curiosity and passion — I wanted to see how far I can push the idea of a ledger service that’s simple, fast, and open. It’s a playground for experimenting with architectures that can handle serious load while keeping the code approachable.

I have many ideas for the future, and I hope I’ll have enough perseverance and time to bring them to life.

## Features

Insert-only ledger operations

High throughput with off-heap memory and ring buffer

WAL as a durability layer

PostgreSQL integration for reporting and persistence

Custom binary protocol over TCP/IP to minimize complexity and maximize throughput

## Planned

Decentralized command exchange between instances

Affinity accounts for better locality and performance

Custom binary protocol over TCP/IP to minimize complexity and maximize throughput

WAL as the single source of truth, with PostgreSQL as both event streaming and durable storage for reports and transactions

Recovery from WAL and operation snapshots

Account tiers: cold, warm, hot, ultra-hot — each with its own handling strategy

Machine learning for automatically choosing account strategies based on operation intensity

Tech Stack

Language: Java

Persistence: PostgreSQL

Logging & Durability: Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

Concurrency: Ring buffer + off-heap memory

## Vision

This project is a mix of fun, research, and ambition. It’s about building a ledger service that’s free, open, and able to grow into something powerful — from ultra-fast financial operations to self-optimizing account management with ML.
